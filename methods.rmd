Methods
========

The first step towards developing an open innovation competition was to transform the deconvolution problem into a supervised classification task. We generated a novel L1000 dataset (976 genes and xxx compounds and xxx shRNA) based on two different detection methods. One, called DUO, in which two genes are measured using the same analyte type, and expression values must be extracted by a deconvolution algorithm. Another one, called UNI, in which each gene is measured individually on one single bead color, and does not require deconvolution to extract the expression values. Then, we used the data obtained from the UNI method (one gene per analyte type) as the ground-truth data; and the data obtained from the DUO method (two genes per analyte type) as data input. Thus, competitors were tasked to predict the 976 gene-expression values measured by UNI with the corresponding 478 DUO measurements in mixed-samples of pairs of matched genes; a subset of about one third of the data was held out for validation (to avoid overfitting). These datasets are now publicly available [LINK to REPO]. 

<!-- FOOTNOTE: Since the L1000 assay returns gene-expression profiles for 978 genes, we combined data from two plates to match the amount of data produced.  -->

Next, we developed a scoring function that combines standard measures of accuracy (spearman rank correlation between algorithmic predictions and the ground-truth data, and AUC between extreme-modulations predicted based on DUO data and observed extreme modulations in UNI data), as well as computational speed to evaluate the submissions received and award the prizes to the best competitors. 

Finally, the competition was run online  on the platform Topcoder (Wipro, India), for a total of 10 days, offering $10,000 in cash prizes as incentive to be divided amont the top 9 submissions (prize split are: 5, 3, 2, 1, 500, ...).

In biomedical research, our focus here, deconvolution problems are common in multianalyte assay methods. These methods are widely used to do X, Y and Z. In general terms, multianalyte assay methods are based on microspheres with different fluorescence decay times. This feature can be used to do X, Y, and Z. [EXPLAIN BRIEFLY CMap PROBLEM].

<!-- alt. wording
In a single experiment, CMap makes 488 measurements, each made by a different colored bead. Each measurement produces an intensity histogram (a list of integers), which characterizes the expression of two distinct genes in the given sample (for a total of 488 x 2 = 976 genes). The genes are mixed in 2:1 ratio. Thus, the areas under the peaks have 2:1 ratio, which enables association of each peak with a specific gene. In the ideal case, each histogram consists of two peaks (see Figure 1), each corresponding to a single gene.

Although the scanner is designed to detect only 500 different bead types, CMap uses it to measure ~1,000 landmark genes (978 genes to be exact). Of the 500 available types, 12 are used to measure controls. The remaining 488 colors are each used to measure two genes. The 976 landmark genes (excluding two genes that are measured independently) are grouped into pairs and coupled to beads of the same color. Genes coupled to the same bead color are combined in a ratio of 2:1 prior to use. So, the detected signal intensity for each bead color provides a composite measure of the abundance of the transcripts of the two genes.

## Statistical deconvolution of gene-specific expression profiles.

In each sample, assume fluorescent-intensity values $X_{ij}$ for beads $i=1,2,\dots, n$ and analytes $j=1,2,\dots, J$, and gene-specific proportions $w_{ik}$ for beads $i=1,2,\dots, n$ and genes $k=1,2,\dots, K$. Our model of analyte fluourescent intensity is:
\[
  X_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_{ik} h_{kj} + e_{ij}. 
\]
where $h_{ik}$ is the gene-expression value for genes $k=1,2,\dots, K$ and analytes $j=1,2,\dots, J$. 

For the $UNI$ detection method, the gene-specific proportions are such that each analyte has only one gene. Hence, $w^{\text{uni}}_{ik} = 1$ when $j = k$, and it is zero otherwise. This implies that each sample can detect at most $J$ different genes under the UNI method. 

For the $DUO$ detection method, the gene-specific proportions are such that each analyte is paired with two genes in 1:2 ratio. Hence, pick an element $g\in G^2$ from the set $G^2$ of all non-overlapping subsets of size two of the gene set $G$. For each pair of genes in $g$ associated with an analyte $j$, we have: $w^{\text{duo}}_{i1} = 2/3$, $w_{i2}=1/3$ and is zero otherwise.

<!-- from problem statement
Each measurement produces an intensity histogram (a list of integers), which characterizes expression of two distinct genes in the sample (for a total of 488 x 2 = 976 genes). In the ideal case, each histogram consists of two peaks (see Figure 1), each corresponding to a single gene. The genes are mixed in 2:1 ratio, thus the areas under the peaks have 2:1 ratio, which allows us to associate each peak with the specific gene. The median position of each peak corresponds to the gene's expression level, and that's what you need to determine in this challenge.
