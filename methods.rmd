Methods
========

Towards developing an open innovation competition, we first transformed the deconvolution problem into a supervised classification task. Using the L1000 assay, we profiled six 384-well plates, each containing different sets of compound and shRNA treatments (see Supporting Info, \ref{data-gen}). The same samples were detected using two different methods. The first method, called UNI, associates each gene to one single bead color, which leads to higher costs, but does not require deconvolution.
The second method, called DUO, meaures two different genes on the same bead color, which reduces costs but requires deconvolution to transform the composite signal into two separate gene-specific expression values.
We then used the data obtained from the UNI method (one gene per bead color) as the "ground truth" for the competition; and the data obtained from the DUO method (two genes per bead color) as the input to predict the equivalent UNI data. The datasets are now publicly available [LINK to REPO]. 

<!-- To do so, the genes are mixed in 1:2 ratio so that the composite signal should have two peaks: a bigger peak for the cluster to the gene for which a larger proportion of beads are present, and a smaller peak representing the other gene.  -->

We randomly split the generated data into training, testing, and holdout datasets of equal size (2 plates each). All the contestants had access to the training data to develop and their solutions offline. The testing data were used to evaluate solutions during the contest and populate the live leaderboard. Holdout data were used to evaluate competitors’ final submissions and guard against over-fitting. Prizes were awarded based on performance on the holdout dataset. 

<!-- FOOTNOTE: Since the L1000 assay returns gene-expression profiles for 978 genes, we combined data from two plates to match the amount of data produced.  -->

To evaluate submissions, we developed a scoring function that combines standard measures of accuracy based on the distance (e.g., correlation) between the predicted values and the ground truth, as well as computational speed (see Supporting Info, \ref{scoring-function}).

The competition run on the platform Topcoder (Wipro, India) for 10 days. A total of $23,000 in cash prizes was offered to competitors as incentive to be divided among the top 9 submissions (prize split: $8000, $6000, $4000, $2000, $1000, $800, $600, $400, $100).

In biomedical research, our focus here, deconvolution problems are common in multianalyte assay methods. These methods are widely used to do X, Y and Z. In general terms, multianalyte assay methods are based on microspheres with different fluorescence decay times. This feature can be used to do X, Y, and Z. [EXPLAIN BRIEFLY CMap PROBLEM].

To identify accurate methods we launched an open challenge that allowed a rapid exploration of different approaches. Key ingredients of there challenges are:

<!-- alt. wording
In a single experiment, CMap makes 488 measurements, each made by a different colored bead. Each measurement produces an intensity histogram (a list of integers), which characterizes the expression of two distinct genes in the given sample (for a total of 488 x 2 = 976 genes). The genes are mixed in 2:1 ratio. Thus, the areas under the peaks have 2:1 ratio, which enables association of each peak with a specific gene. In the ideal case, each histogram consists of two peaks (see Figure 1), each corresponding to a single gene.

Although the scanner is designed to detect only 500 different bead types, CMap uses it to measure ~1,000 landmark genes (978 genes to be exact). Of the 500 available types, 12 are used to measure controls. The remaining 488 colors are each used to measure two genes. The 976 landmark genes (excluding two genes that are measured independently) are grouped into pairs and coupled to beads of the same color. Genes coupled to the same bead color are combined in a ratio of 2:1 prior to use. So, the detected signal intensity for each bead color provides a composite measure of the abundance of the transcripts of the two genes.

## Statistical deconvolution of gene-specific expression profiles.

In each sample, assume fluorescent-intensity values $X_{ij}$ for beads $i=1,2,\dots, n$ and analytes $j=1,2,\dots, J$, and gene-specific proportions $w_{ik}$ for beads $i=1,2,\dots, n$ and genes $k=1,2,\dots, K$. Our model of analyte fluourescent intensity is:
\[
  X_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_{ik} h_{kj} + e_{ij}. 
\]
where $h_{ik}$ is the gene-expression value for genes $k=1,2,\dots, K$ and analytes $j=1,2,\dots, J$. 

For the $UNI$ detection method, the gene-specific proportions are such that each analyte has only one gene. Hence, $w^{\text{uni}}_{ik} = 1$ when $j = k$, and it is zero otherwise. This implies that each sample can detect at most $J$ different genes under the UNI method. 

For the $DUO$ detection method, the gene-specific proportions are such that each analyte is paired with two genes in 1:2 ratio. Hence, pick an element $g\in G^2$ from the set $G^2$ of all non-overlapping subsets of size two of the gene set $G$. For each pair of genes in $g$ associated with an analyte $j$, we have: $w^{\text{duo}}_{i1} = 2/3$, $w_{i2}=1/3$ and is zero otherwise.

<!-- from problem statement
Each measurement produces an intensity histogram (a list of integers), which characterizes expression of two distinct genes in the sample (for a total of 488 x 2 = 976 genes). In the ideal case, each histogram consists of two peaks (see Figure 1), each corresponding to a single gene. The genes are mixed in 2:1 ratio, thus the areas under the peaks have 2:1 ratio, which allows us to associate each peak with the specific gene. The median position of each peak corresponds to the gene's expression level, and that's what you need to determine in this challenge.
