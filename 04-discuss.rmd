## Concluding remarks 


In summary, we have created a novel dataset of over 120 shRNA and compound experiments with measurements for about 1,000 genes. This dataset constitutes a public resource to all the researchers in this area who are interested in testing their deconvolution appproaches. Using an open innovation competition, we collected and evaluated multiple and diverse deconvolution methods. 

The best approach was based on a random forest,  which achieved (i) the highest "global" correlation between UNI and DUO data, (ii) the lowest inter-replicate variability and (iii), compared to the benchmark, was able to detect more than a thousand additional differentially-expressed genes, while improving the detection precision at the same time. 
This provides evidence of the tremendous potential of using machine-learning approaches for deconvolution methods in biology.

Next, we will apply these resutls to over one million experiments that constitute the Connectivity Map, and explore cost svings achieved by having a lower number of replicates. Another potential application is to leverage these algorithms to enable detection of three or more genes using the same analyte type.
