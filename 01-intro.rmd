Introduction
============

Deconvolution problems are commonplace in many areas of science and engineering. In the context of biomedical research, a recurring issue is how to isolate specific gene expressions of distinct populations (cell types, tissues, and genes) from composite measures obtained by a single analyte or sensor. This problem often stems from the prohibitive cost of profiling each population separately [@subramanian2017next; @cleary2017efficient] and has important implications for the analysis of transcriptional data in mixed samples [@shen2010cell; @zhong2012gene; @newman2015robust; @zaitsev2019complete], single-cell data [@deng2019scalable], the study of cell dynamics [@lu2003expression], but it also appears in the analysis of imaging data [@preibisch2014efficient]. 

Existing computational deconvolution approaches work well in many specific settings [@shen2013computational] but they might be suboptimal to the increasing availability of biological data. Machine learning techniques can potentially improve upon current methods. A typical advantage is the ability to capture complicated patterns that can be hard to model otherwise (especially in complex and massive datasets as those frequently used in biomedical research). However, introducing machine learning in the field presents several challenges; some of which are validation, adaptation to complex datasets, and identification of the best machine-learning approaches to specific problems.

Here we describe how we addressed these challenges in the context of the Connectivity Map (CMap). The CMap project is a massive catalog of human gene-expression signatures of genetic or pharmacologic perturbation with lots of applications in drug discovery and development [@subramanian2017next]. The CMap's team has generated millions of perturbation gene expression profiles using a new assay, called L1000. 
Based on a 500-plex fluorescence-based flow cytometry system, L1000 measures a reduced representation of transcriptome comprising 1000 genes that are highly representative of the state of human cells, thus achieving significant cost reductions compared to more traditional methods (RNA-sequencing). However, a key technical challenge is to deconvolute the 500 composite raw signal values for each profile into the 1000 gene expression values. The current approach used in the CMap pipeline is slow and can be susceptible to errors. Below we report improvements to the deconvolution algorithm (dpeak) obtained via an open innovation challenge.
 
For evaluation of new methods, we generated a novel experimental dataset with L1000 profiles for 122 different perturbagens (shRNA and compounds) and several replicates for a total of over 2,200 gene expression experiments. We varied the detection mode for acquiring L1000 data between the current procedure, called DUO, that obtains a raw composite measure of two genes per analyte color, and a more expensive method, called UNI, that measures one gene per analyte color. The deconvolution algorithm processes the DUO data and assigns the correct expression level to each of the two genes whose transcripts bind to beads of the same analyte color. This procedure is not needed with the UNI data. Hence, the UNI data provided ground truth that enabled us to evaluate empirically different deconvolution methods on the DUO data.

Leveraging this data set, we then explored different machine learning approaches through an open innovation competition [@lakhani2013prize; @blasco2019advancing], or contest. We run the contest on Topcoder (Wipro, India), a popular crowdsourcing platform. The contest challenged participants to use the novel dataset to improve the deconvolution algorithm utilized by the L1000 platform. The contest drew about 300 competitors from 20 different countries and resulted in a diverse number of machine-learning approaches. The top approaches included machine-learning methods, such as Random Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as well as more traditional Gaussian-mixture models and k-means. These approaches significantly performed better than the L1000 benchmark in various measures of accuracy and computational speed, and likely have application beyond gene expression.
