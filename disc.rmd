Discussion
==========

Summary of the results presented in the methods section. 

Discussion generality of the solutions

- Novel? Have any of these solutions previously been applied to deconvolution problems?
- Specific to this problem or general to others?

Discuss implications of these methods for CMap production

- Preliminary results on past data conversion
- Directions for pipeline integration and generation of future data
- Cost savings
- Implementation strategy and outcomes
- Increase in data processing throughput
