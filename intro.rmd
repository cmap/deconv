Introduction
============
 
Significant benefits for drug discovery come from the systematic analysis of large repositories of gene-expression profiles. However, traditional multianalyte methods for gene-expression high-throughput profiling, such as Luminex profiling technology, are usually limited by the type and number of available analytes, which represents a prohibitive cost for big data generation in biology.

Using an assay called "L1000," the Connectivity Map (CMap) group at the Broad Institute has developed a novel approach that matches pairs of genes to the same Luminex beads to double the count of profiled genes per bead, thus lowering costs [@subramanian2017next]. A central component of this approach is to statistically deconvolve and compare gene type-specific expression profiles for pairs of mixed-gene samples. 

Deconvolution problems are very common in biology, and several solutions have been proposed. Examples include algorithms to identify cell type–specific gene expression differences in complex tissues [@shen2010cell] or dynamic changes in cell populations [@lu2003expression], or ways to discover the target proteins of small molecules [Jung, 2015].

CMap’s current deconvolution algorithm (called "D-Peak") is based on the K-means clustering. This method automatically partitions a set of gene-expression measurements for each matched pair of genes into $k$ clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares, and then assigns the two largest clusters to each gene of the pair, using additional information about differences in the bead proportions of the genes (within each pair, one gene has a higher proportion of beads than the other).

<!-- mean of the largest cluster to the gene in higher proportion and the mean value of the second largest cluster to the gene in lower proportion -->

The current k-means approach works well in practice, but has several problems as well. 
First, it splits clusters incorrectly even when data are reasonably well separated.
Second, is computationally demanding (finding k clusters takes ... ). 

To test for alternative solutions, we used an open innovation competition as a research tool to engage a variety of computer scientist, software developers and bioinformatics in the problem. This approach allows a cost-effective exploration of competing approaches tailored to our problem [@lakhani2013prize; @blasco2019advancing], that would have been otherwise prohibitive. 

<!-- Testing for alternative methods would have required substantial resources to experiment with these alternative approaches (more than what already done) and to adapt new to our data. Moreover, impossible an exhaustive search for all available approaches to try; and the combination of these different approaches.  -->

<!-- Broadly speaking, the problem is to estimate the density $f$ of a random variable $X$ based on $n$ observations from $Y = X + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a measurement error based on a possibly unknown distribution.  (Fan, 1991) -->

<!-- The solution adopted by CMap was a KNN [explain]. This is a standard technique implemented in xxx that gives a good level of accuracy [xxx] and reasonably fast computation time (xxx with the current Matlab implementation). -->
