## Concluding remarks 

- We have created a dataset of over 120 shRNA and compound experiments with measurements for about 1000 genes. This dataset constitutes a public resource to all the researchers in this area who are interested in testing their deconvoltuion appproaches. 
- However, it remains to be seen performance on combining thre or more genes with single analytes. This is future work. 
- Next, we will apply these resutls to over one million experiments  and explore cost svings achieved by having a lower number of replicates
