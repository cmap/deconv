## Concluding remarks 

- We have created a dataset of over 120 shRNA and compound experiments with measurements for about 1,000 genes. This dataset constitutes a public resource to all the researchers in this area who are interested in testing their deconvoltuion appproaches. 
- This contest yeilded multiple and diverse deconvolution methods. One potential application is to leverage these algorithms to enable detection of three or more genes using the same analyte type.
- Next, we will apply these resutls to over one million experiments  and explore cost svings achieved by having a lower number of replicates
