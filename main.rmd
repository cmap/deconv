## To read

- [Compound signature detection on LINCS L1000 big data](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c4mb00677a) used a fuzzy c-means Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to process raw L1000 data, showing better performance compared to KNN. This method is described below:

> To deconvolute such overlapped peaks, we assumed that the fluorophore intensities of each analyte type (corresponding to a specific mRNA type) had a Gaussian distribution. The distribution of the mixture of analytes GeneH(i) and GeneL(i) corresponding to the expression levels of GeneH and GeneL, respectively, should be subject to a bimodal Gaussian distribution, with the proportion of 1.25 to 0.75. We initialized the estimations of the two Gaussian distributions using buzzy c-means clustering [11] and estimated the GMM parameters using the Nelder-Mead method [12]. Thus, the overlapped peaks were deconvoluted as the two estimated Gaussian peaks and the expression levels of the two genes sharing the same analyte were extracted. Mathematical details are included in the Supplementary Methods (the GMM model).
