 In the context of biomedical research with human cell lines, the ability to extract the expression levels of individual genes from composite samples is of paramount importance.

<!-- Deconvolution problems are ubiquitous and have a long history in many areas of science and engineering.   A common problem of deconvolution algorithms is the validation of results using realistic datasets and the costs involved in tailoring different approaches to specific datasets. We describe the deconvolution problem of an assay, L1000, that measures mRNA transcript abundance of approximately 1000 genes from human cells using 500 Luminex beads, thereby two transcripts are identified by a single bead color. Using L1000, we generated a novel dataset of transcripts for various perturbagens (shRNA and compounds) where genes were measured both in tandem and individually. We then ran an open competition to explore different solutions. The competition produced a wide variety of techniques including machine-learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Random Forests, and more traditional approaches, such as Gaussian mixtures and k-means. All top solutions achieved notable improvements over the benchmark.  -->
